/// A simple neural network model for evaluating Tetris board states based on feature weights.
///
/// `TetrisNeuralNetwork` holds a set of weights, commonly derived from Tetris heuristics,
/// and provides a method to evaluate board features to a single score using a linear combination.
/// The default weights are based on a standard Tetris heuristic, but can be customized or loaded as needed.
///
/// - Note: This implementation uses a fixed number of weights and assumes the input features
///         vector matches in length.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```swift
/// let network = TetrisNeuralNetwork()
/// let features = [aggregateHeight, completeLines, holes, bumpiness]
/// let score = network.evaluate(features)
/// ```
///
/// ## Topics
/// - Feature evaluation
/// - Heuristic-based scoring
/// - Neural network weight management

    var weights: [Double]
    
    init() {
        // Initial weights from a standard Tetris heuristic example
        weights = [-0.510066, 0.760666, -0.35663, -0.184483]
    }
    
    func evaluate(_ features: [Double]) -> Double {
        zip(features, weights).reduce(0) { $0 + $1.0 * $1.1 }
    }
    
    func load(from path: String) {
        // Implement file loading if needed (e.g., JSON deserialization)
        // For demo, left as stub
    }
